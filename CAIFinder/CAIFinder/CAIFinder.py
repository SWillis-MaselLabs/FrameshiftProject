# The purpose of this file is to find the CAI values of gene segments from a 
# tab-delimited file. The CAI, or Codon Adaptation Index, measures the degree of
# to which a gene or gene segment exhibits the same codon bias as the rest of the species

# In the case of this script, the CAI values correspond to sections of overlapping genes
# (in the frame of the gene that contains them). 

# This script takes in two separate files to determine the CAI values. The first is a
# file containing the relative adaptedness values calculated from the raw codon count
# from the species. There is one relative adaptedness value per codon

# The second file contains the gene segments for analysis.

# Here the user may declare the filenames.

# The entries of the file should be the following:
# 1) The sequence UID corresponding the gene to be analyzed
# 2) The viral species to which the gene belongs
# 3) The name of the gene in question to which the overlapping segment belongs
# 4) The nucleotide sequence of the segment. Note: This sequence is the
# Overlapping sequence, not the entire sequence. The overlapping
# sequence should be trimmed so that it's in the same reading frame as the
# overall gene.
