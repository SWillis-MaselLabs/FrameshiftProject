The main program in this directory is FineOverlappingSequence.py 
It’s purpose is to find the nucleotide sequence that is shared by two overlapping genes. 

There are two plain text documents called “Sequence1.fasta” and “Sequence2.fast”. The user can copy and paste the nucleotide sequences of the overlapping genes they want to analyze into these two files in FASTA format. The program will then read them when it is run and will print the shared nucleotide sequence to stdout.
