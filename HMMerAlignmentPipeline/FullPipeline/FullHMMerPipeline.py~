# The purpose of this file is to read in two tab-delimited files
# that have been downloaded from a MySQL database. The first
# is a file containing overlapping genes, the second is a file
# containing non-overlapping controls.

# The Overlapping genes file will have the following entries:
# [1] UID
# [2] Gene Name
# [3] Overlapping Nucleotide Sequence (in the same frame as the
# overall gene)

# The controls file will have the following entries:
# [1] UID
# [2] Gene Designation (either Coding Gene, Scrambled, or
# Artificially Frameshifted)
# [3] Protein Sequence

# We want to run the overlapping sections of the overlapping genes,
# the frameshifted controls and the coding genes through the program
# HMMer to see if there are any homologous genes. This program will utilize
# phmmer to assign homology group IDs. It will then output two files:
# [1] The UIDs and homology group IDs for the overlapping genes
# in tab-delimited format
# [2] The same as the above, but for the non-overlapping controls.
