# The purpose of this program is to take in data from a tab-delimited file,
# and return two different nucleotide sequences
# in tab-delimited format. The two sequences will be the original sequence
# artificially frameshifted into the +1 and +2 frame. The results will
# be printed to two tab-delimited files .

# All shifting and manipulating is done with the stop and start codons
# removed from the body of the sequence. The start and stop codons are
# reattached and the end of the program to each sequence.
# All sequences will have any stop codons appearing in the new reading frame


#First the sequences is read from a tab-delimited file.

# OutputList is a list created for each entry and will be where the output
# data will be stored and will eventually be printed from
# UID is the unique ID associated with the entry from the MySQL database where it's stored
# Family is the viral family the gene is from
# Species is the name of the viral species where the gene is from
# GenomeAccession is the ncbi accession number where the gene can be accessed
# GeneDesignation is the control designation for the gene in question. Unshifted genes
# should have a designation of ControlGene. The output frameshifted sequences will be given a
# different GeneDesignation, either ShiftedReadingFrameControlPlusOne or
# ShiftedReadingFrameControlPlusOne depending on the frameshift type
# Gene is the name of the gene
# NucleotideSequence is the input nucleotide sequence which will be used to generate the controls
# ProteinSequence is the translated NucleotideSequence
# NoCysProtein is the translated NucleotideSequence with all cysteines removed

# Format of Output of this file:
# 1 - UID
# 2 - Family
# 3 - Species
# 4 - Genome Accession Number
# 5 - Protein Accession Number
# 6 - Gene Designation
# 7 - Gene Name
# 8 - Nucleotide Sequence
# 9 - Protein Sequence
# 10 - Protein Sequence (No Cys)



# For the purposes of keeping track of entries, a counter is introduced here, and will count the
# number of entries that are successfully manipulated.
